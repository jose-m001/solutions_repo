Gravitational Acceleration (g): Affects how fast the projectile falls, reducing \ud835\udc45 as \ud835\udc54 increases. Launch Angle (\ud835\udf03): The range depends on sin(2\ud835\udf03)sin(2\u03b8), peaking at \ud835\udf03=45\u2218. Analysis of the Range The range \ud835\udc45 as a function of \ud835\udf03 follows: \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udf03)=\ud835\udc6302\ud835\udc54sin(2\ud835\udf03) It is a parabolic function of sin(2\ud835\udf03), with a maximum at \ud835\udf03=45\u2218. Influence of Parameters Initial Velocity (\ud835\udc630): Doubling \ud835\udc630 quadruples the range (\ud835\udc45\u221d\ud835\udc6302). Gravitational Acceleration (\ud835\udc54): Higher \ud835\udc54 reduces the range (\ud835\udc45\u221d1/\ud835\udc54). Angle of Projection (\ud835\udf03): The range peaks at 45\u2218 and is symmetric about it. Practical Applications Uneven Terrain: Adjust \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc61) to account for non-zero launch or landing height: \ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc61)=\ud835\udc660+\ud835\udc630sin(\ud835\udf03)\u22c5\ud835\udc61\u221212\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc612 Solve for \ud835\udc47 using the quadratic formula, and substitute \ud835\udc47 into \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61)x(t) for the adjusted range. Air Resistance: Introduce a drag force proportional to velocity: \ud835\udc39drag=\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc63 This leads to coupled differential equations, requiring numerical methods for solutions. Implementation Steps for Simulation Algorithm: Input parameters: \ud835\udc630, \ud835\udc54,\ud835\udf03,\ud835\udc660. Calculate range \ud835\udc45 for various \ud835\udf03 values (e.g., from 0\u2218 to 90\u2218). Visualization: Plot \ud835\udc45 vs. \ud835\udf03 for different \ud835\udc630, \ud835\udc54, or \ud835\udc660. Overlay plots to compare how each parameter influences the range.
